# ðŸŒ¿ Plant Disease Detection

This project detects plant leaf diseases using **Machine Learning (SVM, Random Forest)** and **Deep Learning (Custom CNN)**.  
It also includes a **Gradio app** for easy predictions from uploaded leaf images.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Preprocessing: Image resizing, normalization, label encoding
- Models:
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Random Forest
  - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- User Interfaces:
  - Gradio Web UI
- Training & Evaluation scripts
- Visualization of dataset histograms and training curves

## ðŸ“Œ Dataset
- The project uses the [PlantVillage dataset](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/tywbtsjrjv/1) from Kaggle
---

## ðŸ“Š Results
- CNN Accuracy: ~89% (can be improved with data augmentation / transfer learning)
- SVM & Random Forest: Lower than CNN
- Confusion matrix and training curves are available in results/
